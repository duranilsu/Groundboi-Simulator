It's that time of year, and it's time to find Ground Boi. He could be anywhere, but where is he?

## Summary

Ground Boi Simulator is a guessing game where the player has to figure out which of the three holes Ground Boi is hiding in. But there's not only a Ground Boi lurking underground--there's also an innocent Rocky! Hitting the Ground Boi will score you points, but finding Rocky will make you lose some.

### Point System

Points are allocated in the following way:

- Hit a Ground Boi: 3 pts
- Hit a Rocky: -1 pt
